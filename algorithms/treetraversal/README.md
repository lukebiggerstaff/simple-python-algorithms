# Python Tree Traversals [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukebiggerstaff/simple-python-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukebiggerstaff/simple-python-algorithms)

## Layout
folder consists of README, a test file and the implementation

## Testing
> from within the root directory run the following command
```sh
python -m unittest algorithms.treetraversal.test_treetraversal -vvv
flake8 ./algorithms/treetraversal
```

## Usage
tree traversal algorithms are used to visit all nodes of a tree in a specific order, there are three variants: pre-order, inorder, postorder.

## Time Complexity
Algorithm takes O(n) time and O(1) additional space
